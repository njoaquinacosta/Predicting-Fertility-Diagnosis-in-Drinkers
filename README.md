Predicting Fertility Diagnosis in Drinkers


Abstract: 

100 volunteers provide a semen sample analyzed according to the WHO 2010 criteria. Sperm concentration are related to socio-demographic data, environmental factors, health status, and life habits.

Problem Statement: 

What impact does alcohol consumption have on the fertility diagnoses (sperm concentration) of males (keeping in mind that sperm concentration are related to socio-demographic and environmental factors, health status, as well as habits accosicated with individual lifestyle)?
